description: Revoke a registered server — tear down remote gate and drop the alias
argument-hint: <alias>
allowed-tools: mcp__sshgate__revoke_server
---

The user invoked `/sshgate:revoke <alias>`. This is destructive: it
removes the `command="..."` line from the remote's `authorized_keys`,
deletes `~/.sshgate-gate/` on the remote, and drops the alias from the
local registry.

Parse the first positional argument as `alias`. Validate it matches
`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}` — same rule as `/sshgate:add`. If empty or
malformed, print:

```
Usage: /sshgate:revoke <alias>
Alias must match [a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}.
```

…and stop. Do not prompt the user inline; this command is scriptable.

Before calling the tool, tell the user verbatim:

> Revoking `<alias>` issues a signed SSHGATE_REVOKE — you'll get a
> Telegram approval prompt. Approve it to proceed.

Then call `mcp__sshgate__revoke_server` with `{ "alias": "<alias>" }`.

Surface the tool's output:

- `remote_cleaned` (bool) — did gate confirm `SSHGATE_REVOKED` on the remote?
- `registry_removed` (bool) — was the alias dropped from `~/.config/sshgate/servers.json`?
- `message` — human-readable summary from the tool.

On success (both bools true), print:

```
✓ Revoked '<alias>'.
  Remote cleaned, alias removed from registry.
  Run /sshgate:status to confirm.
```

If the tool returns an error, print it verbatim. Common failure
modes — surface but do not invent fixes:

- Telegram approval denied or timed out → say so; ask the user if
  they want to retry.
- Remote unreachable → the registry entry stays; tell the user the
  alias is still listed locally and they can re-run revoke later or
  edit `~/.config/sshgate/servers.json` by hand.
- Alias not registered → surface verbatim; suggest
  `/sshgate:status` to see what is registered.

Do not loop. One attempt per invocation.
