// SSHGate dedicated key; the forwarded command from the client arrives
// in $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND.
//
// Exit codes (BSD sysexits where applicable):
//
//	0  — success (also: empty SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND, the post-install
//	     verification probe; prints SSHGATE_OK and exits 0)
//	1  — generic runtime failure or non-zero from /bin/sh -c on the
//	     non-pass-through paths (the stub SSHGATE_REVOKE/SSHGATE_UPDATE
//	     handlers fall here)
//	65 — EX_DATAERR: bad signature, bad envelope format, expired sig,
//	     validity window too long
//	70 — EX_SOFTWARE: pubkey file unreadable, corrupt, or has insecure
//	     mode
//	77 — EX_NOPERM: write command without a verified SSHGATE_SIG prefix
//
// Exit codes from the executed inner command are passed through
// directly (so /bin/sh -c 'exit 42' makes gate exit 42).
//
// Stdio discipline: gate's own log lines go to stderr only,
// prefixed with "gate: ". Stdout is reserved for the executed
// inner command's stdout. The post-install probe is the one
// exception — it prints exactly "SSHGATE_OK" to stdout because the
// installer reads that line over SSH to confirm the gate is alive.
