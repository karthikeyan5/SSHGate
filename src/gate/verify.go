// VerifySigned parses line as a SSHGATE_SIG envelope, verifies its
// Ed25519 signature against pubkey, and enforces the spec's time
// bounds and per-server host-key binding:
//
//   - exp must be strictly greater than now (now >= exp ⇒ ErrExpired)
//   - exp - ts must not exceed sigwire.MaxSigValidity
//   - the inner cmd must be non-empty
//   - the payload's Host fingerprint must match one of selfHostFPs (the
//     gate's OWN host-key fingerprints, derived from /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*.pub
//     at process start) ⇒ otherwise ErrHostMismatch
//
// The host binding makes a signature approved for one server cryptographically
// un-replayable on another: the signer copies the target's pinned host
// fingerprint into the payload, and each gate independently verifies that the
// binding names ITSELF. It is fail-closed — an empty payload.Host, or an empty
// selfHostFPs set, is a mismatch (a signed write must always carry a binding
// that the executing gate recognises).
//
// selfHostFPs are the fingerprints in canonical hostkey.Fingerprint form
// ("SHA256:..."). The host check runs LAST, after signature and time
// verification, so an unauthenticated caller cannot probe the gate's host set.
//
// On success, the inner cmd string AND the verified reveal flag are returned.
// reveal is true only when the AUTHENTICATED payload set it: it is read from
// the signed bytes, never from any agent input, so the (untrusted) agent
// cannot self-elevate to an un-redacted reveal. The caller threads reveal into
// the executor (output is run WITHOUT the redactor when reveal is true) only on
// this signed path. On any failure reveal is false (the zero value) and no
// command leaks through — the capability is never surfaced for a payload that
// did not fully verify.
//
// On failure, the returned error wraps one of the package's sentinels
// (ErrBadFormat, ErrBadSig, ErrExpired, ErrValidityTooLong,
// ErrEmptyCmd, ErrHostMismatch) so callers can match with errors.Is.
//
// VerifySigned is the only correct way to unwrap a SSHGATE_SIG line —
// callers MUST NOT execute the inner cmd from sigwire.DecodeSigned
// alone, because DecodeSigned does not verify the signature.
