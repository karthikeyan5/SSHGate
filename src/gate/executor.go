// ExecOpts holds the optional redactor wiring for a single command.
//
// SessionSalt is a per-process 32-byte random value used for HMAC
// marker keys. Generated once at gate startup (see
// cmd/sshgate-gate/main.go) and never persisted.
//
// Rules is the compiled-in ruleset (typically rules.Combined()). When
// empty, both Stdout and Stderr pass through with no redaction —
// equivalent to v1.0 behaviour, useful for tests that exercise the
// raw executor.
//
// Reveal, when true, runs the command's output WITHOUT the redactor even
// when Rules is non-empty — the SECRET-REVEAL path, where raw secret values
// are intentionally allowed to flow to the agent. It is a SEPARATE, explicit
// field (NOT conflated with "Rules is empty"): an empty ruleset is a
// configuration state, whereas Reveal is a per-command, signed authorisation.
// The gate sets Reveal only from the verified signed payload (see
// gate.VerifySigned) on the signed path; the unsigned read path never sets it.

	// capped at this many bytes PER STREAM. This is ONLY for the gate-side
	// audit `all+full` (verbose) level; the default path leaves it 0 so

// The byte counts are measured at the point the bytes actually reach the
// SSH stream — i.e. POST-redaction. That is deliberately what the agent
// receives, so an audit of "how much data flowed back" reflects reality
// (a redacted secret counts as the marker length, not the raw length).
//
// Lines counts '\n' bytes seen across stdout (the conventional
// line-count; a trailing partial line without a newline is not counted,
// matching `wc -l`). StderrBytes is tracked separately from StdoutBytes
// because the two streams are wrapped in independent writers.

// child's 0..255 code, 128+signum when signalled, or -1 if the process

// ExecWithRedaction runs cmd via "/bin/sh -c <cmd>", streaming the child's

// instances so every byte the child emits passes through the streaming
// scrubber before reaching the SSH stream; when opts.Rules is empty — or
// opts.Reveal is true (the signed SECRET-REVEAL path) — both streams pass
// through unredacted. It blocks until the child exits or ctx is cancelled,
// whichever comes first.
//
// The redactor lives at the gate boundary by design (see
// docs/redaction-architecture.md §"Where
// it lives") — the MCP-side trust boundary is bypassable; the gate

// Return values:
//
//   - res.ExitCode is the child's exit code in the range 0..255. When the
//     process is killed by a signal (including ctx cancellation), the
//     exit code is reported as 128+signum, matching the convention used
//     by shells. If the process never started (e.g. /bin/sh missing),
//     ExitCode is -1.
//   - res also carries output METADATA (StdoutBytes/StderrBytes/Lines/
//     Duration), measured at the bytes that reach the SSH stream
//     (post-redaction). This feeds the gate-side audit log's `all+meta`
//     level without ever capturing raw output. See ExecResult.
//   - err is non-nil only on start failures. A nonzero exit code from a
//     successfully-started child is NOT an error from gate's
//     perspective — the caller is expected to propagate ExitCode as
//     gate's own exit status.
//
// It sets a process group on the child so that ctx cancellation kills the

// spawn subprocesses (e.g. pipelines) that would otherwise be reparented to
// PID 1 and outlive cancellation.
