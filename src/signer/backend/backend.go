// the MCP; backends include it in their UI when relevant.

// readable alias from the MCP's registry (e.g. "prod-db"); Cmd is the
// literal shell command line; TTLSec is the spec's signature validity
// window (`exp - ts`), bounded by sigwire.MaxSigValidity (5 minutes).
//
// Reveal marks this as a SECRET-REVEAL: if approved, the gate runs the
// command's output WITHOUT the redactor (raw secrets flow to the agent). The
// approval UX MUST render reveal distinctly and scarily. Reason is the
// mandatory human-readable justification the operator sees; it is required
// (enforced MCP-side) whenever Reveal is true, and shown in the approval
// message so the human knows WHY raw secrets are being requested. Both are
// zero for ordinary writes.

// returns StatusDenied as a constant and the daemon checks the status
// explicitly before signing.)

//
// Request submits the approval request and returns a channel that will
// yield exactly one Result. On a hard error during submission, Request
// returns the error and no channel; once a channel has been returned,
// the daemon's only contract with the caller is to read one Result from
// it. Implementations decide their own timeout policy independent of
// ctx; they SHOULD honour ctx cancellation by yielding StatusTimeout (or
// a more specific status if defined later).
