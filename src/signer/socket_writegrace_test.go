// These tests guard F1: a verdict that resolves at the approval-wait
// deadline must still be DELIVERED to the client as a proper JSON status
// line, not lost to a torn-down connection (which the MCP would see as a
// bare EOF / i-o-timeout with no sentinel).
//
// The fix splits serveOne's single absolute deadline into a WAIT budget
// (= HandlerTimeout - sigwire.ResponseWriteGrace) driving both the
// connection's initial deadline AND connCtx, and the daemon RESETS the
// connection write deadline to now + ResponseWriteGrace immediately before
// each response write. So when the wait deadline fires and the daemon
// resolves "timeout" via ctx.Done(), the verdict line still has a fresh,
// full grace to reach the client.
//
// Distinguishing old from new: the backend here NEVER resolves a real
// verdict within the connection's lifetime, so the daemon's ctx.Done()
// branch produces "timeout" in BOTH designs. The difference is delivery:
//   - NEW: connCtx fires at the wait budget (HandlerTimeout - grace); the
//     daemon resets the write deadline to now + grace (a full 5s) and the
//     "timeout" line lands.
//   - OLD (single shared deadline = HandlerTimeout): connCtx and the write
//     deadline expire at the SAME instant, so the post-decision write has
//     zero budget — it fails and the connection is torn down (client EOF).
// HandlerTimeout is set just over ResponseWriteGrace so the wait budget is
// a small positive slice and the test resolves quickly.
