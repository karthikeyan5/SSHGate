// delayedBackend resolves every request with a fixed Result after a fixed

// fixture this regression needs: MockBackend resolves synchronously, so
// it cannot exercise the "approval arrives mid-connection, after some
// wall-clock has elapsed" path that the HandlerTimeout bug lived on.
//
// Request honours ctx cancellation: if the daemon's connCtx fires before
// the delay elapses, we stop the timer and never send — the daemon's own
// <-ctx.Done() branch then resolves the request as timeout, exactly as a
// real backend's contract requires (backend.Backend doc: "SHOULD honour
// ctx cancellation by yielding StatusTimeout").

//
// Note on what is and isn't deterministic here, and why this test asserts
// the negative rather than a delivered "timeout" line: serveOne uses a
// SINGLE absolute deadline (HandlerTimeout) for BOTH the daemon's connCtx
// (approval-wait budget) AND the connection's write deadline. So at the
// instant connCtx fires and the daemon resolves "timeout", the connection
// write deadline has ALSO just expired, leaving zero budget to write the
// timeout response — the write fails with i/o timeout and the client
// observes EOF. (That coupling is precisely the structural reason a
// too-short HandlerTimeout is dangerous: it eats the very write budget the
// post-decision response needs.) Asserting a delivered "timeout" JSON line
// would therefore be racy/flaky. What IS deterministic and meaningful is
// the security-relevant invariant: a decision arriving after the window is
// never delivered as an approved signature. Either outcome below satisfies
// that: (a) the connection is torn down (read error / EOF), or (b) a
