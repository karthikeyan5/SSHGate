// are NOT security bypasses (the two real read-only-gate bypasses are pinned
// in classifier_bypass_test.go). Some rows pin a deliberately over-conservative
// false-positive (a read command classified WRITE): that is the fail-safe
// direction, and pinning it documents the behavior + guards against a
// "cleanup" that silently widens the read surface. Each row notes whether it
// is correct-by-design or an accepted over-conservative FP.
