// TestClassify_BackslashEscapeBypass pins the CRITICAL read-only-gate bypass
// found by the 2026-06-14 adversarial review: the quote scanners
// (tokenize / splitSegments / hasTopLevelRedirect / containsSubstitution)
// did not honor a backslash before a quote, but /bin/sh treats `\'` and `\"`
// as LITERAL characters, not quote openers. So a single `\'` after a read
// head opened a phantom quote in the classifier that swallowed the rest of
// the line — separators, redirects, and `$(...)` all vanished — while
// /bin/sh ran it all live. That turned the read-only gate into UNSIGNED RCE.
//
// The fix: a backslash escapes the next byte everywhere except inside single
// quotes (where sh treats backslash as literal). The escaped byte is literal
// data and cannot open/close a quote, separate a command, redirect, or start
// a substitution.
