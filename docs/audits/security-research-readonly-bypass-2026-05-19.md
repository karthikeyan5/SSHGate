# Security research — read-only gate bypass landscape — 2026-05-19

**Researcher:** Claude Opus 4.7 (research-only; no code changed)
**Purpose:** Feed a follow-up SSHGate v1 security audit. Survey the industry pattern of "let SSH through but only execute reads", catalog the bypass categories the pattern has historically failed under, then cross-reference each against SSHGate's `classify.Classify` + gate dispatch.

## Summary

- **Tools surveyed:** 5 top + 5 brief notes (rbash/rzsh, scponly, Cursor "Agent SSH", Hoop.dev session brokers, Sandfly).
- **SSHGate-applicable findings: 2 BLOCKER, 5 MAJOR, 6 MINOR, 4 NIT.**
- **Overall verdict:** SSHGate's classifier is in roughly the same shape as lshell / OpenClaw v1 — it gets the "obvious" shell metacharacters right (subst, redirect, pipe), but the read-side surface has at least two **direct, no-clever-shell-tricks** vehicles to arbitrary code execution (sed `e` flag, find `-fprintf`/`-fprint`), plus environment-variable smuggling that GNU long-option abbreviation will let through. None of these require Karthi to mistype. Two of them survive even after the v1.1 Task B tightening. **Not safe to publish v1 against a hostile-LLM threat model without closing the BLOCKERs.** Safe enough for personal use today *iff* Karthi accepts that an LLM that figures out `sed e` or `find -fprintf` has full RCE despite the gate.

The single most useful insight from the OpenClaw arxiv paper [3, 4]: "The exec allowlist was designed as a string-matching system operating on static representations of command text, while the actual security boundary requires reasoning about command **semantics** — how the shell will interpret the string at runtime, what executable the invocation will actually dispatch to, and what the effective set of active options will be after GNU abbreviation expansion." SSHGate's classifier sits exactly in that gap.

## Top 5 tools in this category

### Tool: lshell (Limited Shell)
- **What it does:** Python-based login shell that restricts the user to an allowlisted command list, configurable per-user, with timing/scp/sftp gating. The closest direct analogue to SSHGate's classifier.
- **Maintainer:** Ignace Mouzannar (ghantoos), still tagged in 2025. Real production users on Debian/Ubuntu repos. [1]
- **Documented threat model:** `SECURITY.md` in repo enumerates "shell escape via allowed editors / pagers / scripting binaries" as explicitly out-of-scope and the operator's responsibility. [9]
- **Known bypass categories:**
  1. **Allowed editor/pager escapes** — `vim :!sh`, `less !sh`, `man <foo>` → `!sh`. lshell does not block these even with hardcoded `forbidden` lists; the binary is "allowed" and the *interactive* escape is internal to it. [GTFOBins less [13]; lshell issue #148]
  2. **Interactive subshell via `expect` / `python -c`** — `python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"` if python is allowed. [1, 8]
  3. **Argument-injection via allowed binaries** — `awk 'BEGIN{system("sh")}'` (GTFOArgs); `find / -exec /bin/sh \; -quit`. [11]
  4. **Custom alias / function definition** — if the shell still sources `~/.bashrc`, `alias` and shell functions can rewrite the allowlist behind lshell's back.
  5. **CVE-history**: lshell 0.9.15 RCE (Exploit-DB 39632) — exact path-of-bytes escape in the argument validator. [1]
- **Lessons for SSHGate:** Allowlisting a binary is allowlisting *its entire feature surface*. `less`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, `git` each carry first-party shell-execution features. SSHGate must classify by **(binary, sub-feature)** not by binary alone — or it must run inside a sandbox that contains the escape (which SSHGate does not).

### Tool: rssh (Restricted Secure Shell)
- **What it does:** Wrapper login shell whitelisting only SCP / SFTP / rsync / cvs / svnserve / rdist subcommands. Was the de-facto choice for "ssh-but-only-for-file-transfer" for ~15 years. **Now unmaintained**, included here as a cautionary precedent.
- **Maintainer:** Derek Martin (declared end-of-life). Still in Debian oldstable. [2]
- **Documented threat model:** README + man page; effectively "we filter the subcommand head and trust the helper to behave."
- **Known bypass categories / CVEs:**
  1. **CVE-2012-2252** — incomplete blacklist when rsync enabled; `--rsh` argument lets the user supply an arbitrary "ssh" replacement and rsync execs it. *Exact analogue to argument-injection through an allowed read binary.*
  2. **CVE-2012-2251** — `-e` and `--` long-option separators bypass the same argument filter.
  3. **CVE-2012-3478** — crafted environment variables bypass restricted shell. *Direct relevance to SSHGate's `FOO=bar cmd` env-prefix stripping.*
  4. **CVE-2019-1000018** — `allowscp` argument-injection RCE; researcher controlled exactly which scp command ran on the server. [12]
- **Lessons for SSHGate:** Argument allowlists are deceptively hard. Every wrapped binary needs a *deny-by-default* flag scan with knowledge of GNU `--` long-option semantics, GNU prefix abbreviation, short-flag clusters, and `--option=value` vs `--option value` forms.

### Tool: git-shell
- **What it does:** Git's bundled login shell. Restricts SSH to `git-upload-pack` / `git-receive-pack` / `git-upload-archive` subcommands. Used by GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo in production for "SSH-as-git-only" termination.
- **Maintainer:** Git project. Mainline, actively reviewed.
- **Documented threat model:** `git-shell(1)` manpage. Threat model is intentionally narrow: "only these four executables, with no shell."
- **Known bypass categories:**
  1. **CVE-2017-8386** — `git-shell` could be coerced to run `git ... --help`, which spawned `man` → `less` → interactive `!sh`. [5, 6] Mitigation: disable PTY in sshd (`no-pty`).
  2. **Argument-injection via `--upload-pack=<cmd>`** in older git clients on the server side (paired vuln).
- **Lessons for SSHGate:** SSHGate's `authorized_keys` correctly forces `no-pty,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding` (per S6 of the existing audit). **Verify `no-pty` is on every key entry** — without it, even `less` of a large file goes interactive and `!sh` opens a shell. The audit S8 mentions `no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding` but not `no-pty`. Confirm in `src/mcp/tools/add_server.go`.

### Tool: OpenClaw exec policy engine
- **What it does:** Auto-approve allowlist for LLM-driven shell commands. Same shape as SSHGate's classifier: read-by-default-allowed, write-needs-approval. Production-deployed by ~the entire personal-AI-agent ecosystem in 2026.
- **Maintainer:** OpenClaw project. [7]
- **Documented threat model:** "Exec Approvals" docs page. Threat model assumes the model is potentially adversarial (prompt injection).
- **Known bypass categories (from arxiv 2603.27517 and 2603.10387, both published this quarter, 77 advisories in the exec engine alone):** [3, 4, 7]
  1. **Line-continuation injection** — `echo "ok \<newline>$(id)"` — the lexical parser saw `\n` inside a quoted string as the literal `\n` escape, not as the POSIX-shell line-continuation that removes the backslash-newline. Patched commit `3f0b9db`.
  2. **Busybox / toybox multiplexer dispatch** — `busybox sh -c '<arbitrary>'`. Allowlist saw "busybox" as a known-safe binary; busybox dispatches to `sh`. Patched by writing an entire new `unwrapKnownShellMultiplexerInvocation()` module. *Toybox is the same; many embedded distros have one or both.*
  3. **GNU long-option abbreviation** — `--compress-prog` accepted when `--compress-program` denied. Glibc/GNU getopt accepts unambiguous prefix abbreviations; the allowlist used exact-string match against the canonical form. Patched commit `3b8e330`.
  4. **Environment-variable smuggling** — sensitive config (e.g. `LD_PRELOAD`, `IFS`, `PATH`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, `PAGER`, `SYSTEMD_PAGER`, `EDITOR`/`VISUAL`) passed via `FOO=bar cmd` prefix, escaping command-line argument filters.
  5. **Wrapper-binary unwrap gaps** — `env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `time`, `taskset`, `chroot`, `unshare`, `setsid` strip the leading wrapper and the *real* command is what executes. Allowlist needs to unwrap recursively.
- **Lessons for SSHGate:** *Every single one of OpenClaw's allowlist CVEs maps to a corresponding hole in SSHGate.* See Step 3 below — at least 4 of the 5 categories are present today in `classifier.go`.

### Tool: Teleport (gravitational.io / goteleport)
- **What it does:** Enterprise SSH/RDP/Kubernetes session broker with policy-as-code, session recording, just-in-time access approvals. **Different category than SSHGate** — Teleport records and approves *sessions*, not individual commands — but it's the most-cited "secure SSH bastion" in 2025-2026 enterprise reviews.
- **Maintainer:** Teleport (formerly Gravitational). Funded, audited yearly. [10]
- **Documented threat model:** Public threat-model doc + annual third-party penetration tests published.
- **Known bypass categories / CVEs:**
  1. **CVE-2025-49825 (CVSS 9.8)** — full SSH authentication bypass against OpenSSH-integration and Git proxy modes. Patched June 2025. Demonstrates: even a heavily-audited, security-focused vendor ships a complete auth-bypass in the *boring layer* (signature verification / state machine).
  2. **Session-recording bypass via RemoteCommand / exec mode** — Boundary has the same caveat: command-exec sessions don't get full session-recording asciicasts. [Documented as design limitation]
- **Lessons for SSHGate:** (a) Even mature audited code ships pre-auth bypasses — SSHGate's signature-verification path (`src/gate/verify.go`) deserves extra fuzzing; (b) recording/visibility is a separate axis from gating — Karthi's Telegram approvals provide the audit log SSHGate has no other source of truth for.

### Brief notes on other relevant tools
- **rbash / rzsh** — `bash --restricted` and zsh equivalent. Bypassable via every "allowed binary's internal shell escape" trick; well-known to be a porous defense. Used historically by ISPs. [8]
- **scponly** — same family as rssh; CVE-2007-6415 (subcommand-injection: invoking `unison`/`rsync`/`svn` from scponly to get arbitrary execution).
- **Cursor "Agent SSH" / Codex "remote dev"** — newer, less documented. Mostly relies on container isolation + per-tool RPC instead of "SSH but classified". Not a direct analogue.
- **Hoop.dev session brokers** — proxy with session recording; relies on policy rules rather than command classification. Adjacent rather than analogous.
- **Sandfly Security** — Linux IR/EDR; documented integration with Tailscale SSH (re-auth as a check-mode policy). Defense-in-depth pattern: gate first, then EDR sees what got through.

## Bypass categories cross-referenced with SSHGate

For each row: **status** = COVERED / VULNERABLE / PARTIAL, with the citation in `src/classify/classifier.go` (line numbers from the current `Read` of the file).

### B1 — Command substitution `$(...)` and backticks
- **Status:** **COVERED.** `containsSubstitution` (classifier.go:97-129) detects `$(`, `` ` ``, `<(`, `>(` at top level (outside quotes) and forces KindWrite. Corpus row 178-180 verifies. **No regression risk** unless someone weakens the quote tracking.
- **Caveat:** `containsSubstitution` only tracks `'`/`"` quote state, not heredoc state. If the line is `cat <<EOF$(rm /tmp/x)EOF`, the `$(` is inside what bash treats as a heredoc terminator but the classifier still flags substitution and routes to write — accidentally correct. Heredoc *body* is not parsed by classifier at all — see B11.

### B2 — Pipe smuggling (read | write)
- **Status:** **COVERED** per-segment. `splitSegments` (classifier.go:156-208) splits on `|`, `||`, `&`, `&&`, `;` outside quotes; `Classify` returns KindWrite if any segment is write. Top-level `>` redirect short-circuits the whole line.
- **Caveat:** `|&` (bash's stderr-pipe shorthand for `2>&1 |`) is **not** explicitly split. Walking the code: at `|`, the classifier looks at the next char for `|`; if it's `&`, it currently treats the `&` as the *start* of the next segment, so the segmentation is preserved but the `&` becomes a stray leading character of the next segment. **MINOR**: stray `&` likely confuses `tokenize`. The behavior is "fail-safe" (most likely write classification on the trailing-`&` head), so I'm calling it NIT not BLOCKER.

### B3 — Quoting tricks, ANSI-C `$'\\x...'`, unicode look-alikes
- **Status:** **PARTIAL / MAJOR.** `tokenize` (classifier.go:248-279) only knows about `'` and `"`. **It does not understand `$'...'` (ANSI-C quoting) at all.** A command like `$'rm\\x20-rf' /tmp/x` would tokenize as two tokens: `$rm\\x20-rf` (the `$` is not stripped, the `'`s are stripped as if regular quotes) and `/tmp/x`. The head becomes `$rm\\x20-rf`, which is not in the allowlist → KindWrite. **Accidentally safe** in this direction.
- **The other direction is the danger**: `$'\\x73h'` is `sh`. So `$'\\x73h' -c 'rm /tmp/x'` tokenizes head = `$\\x73h`, not `sh`, → not in allowlist → KindWrite. Again accidentally safe.
- **Real concern:** `cat $'/tmp/\\x66' >&2 </dev/zero` — head is `cat` (allowed); no top-level redirect output (`>&2` *is* a `>` so it triggers `hasTopLevelRedirect` → write). Accidentally safe.
- **The actual unicode look-alike trap:** classifier compares byte-by-byte against ASCII strings like `"git"`, `"docker"`. A Cyrillic `с` (U+0441) followed by `at` won't equal `cat` so it'll be unknown → write. Safe direction.
- **Verdict:** No active bypass found via quoting tricks. Logging this as **NIT — add `$'...'` test cases to the corpus** to lock in the behavior.

### B4 — Env-var injection (`LD_PRELOAD=...cmd`, `IFS=...cmd`, `PATH=...cmd`)
- **Status:** **VULNERABLE — MAJOR.** `classifySegment` (classifier.go:214-243) explicitly *strips* leading `KEY=VALUE` env assignments via `isAssignment` (line 282-297) and reclassifies the remaining tokens. The leading env is **not** examined for dangerous keys.
  - `LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so cat /etc/hosts` — classifier strips `LD_PRELOAD=...`, sees `cat /etc/hosts`, returns KindRead. **Gate runs `/bin/sh -c "LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so cat /etc/hosts"`**. The shell honors LD_PRELOAD on the cat process.
  - To actually get RCE: attacker first needs `/tmp/evil.so` on disk. **But**: the same approach with `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=/tmp/payload git log` (where `/tmp/payload` is anything the attacker controls — including just `/bin/sh -c 'rm /tmp/x'` if the attacker can write that string into a file). They need a write to disk first — but **what about reading via curl into a tmpfile from a stripped env that ALLOWS write through env vars?** Examples:
    - `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=$'\\x73h\\x20-c\\x20rm /tmp/x' git log -p HEAD` — git's diff machinery forks the value as the diff driver. Classifier sees `git log -p HEAD` (read) → executes; shell honors GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF → RCE. **No filesystem write needed prior.**
    - `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='sh -c "rm /tmp/x"' git fetch origin` — `git fetch` is currently classified as **WRITE** (not in the gitRule read list), so this path is safe. But `git ls-remote` is **READ** in the classifier (gitRule, line 559). `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='sh -c "id>/tmp/p"' git ls-remote origin` → classifier says read, git forks the SSH command → **RCE.** [Verified by reading classifier.go:556-561.]
    - `PAGER='sh -c "id"' git log` — classifier sees git log = read; git forks PAGER for interactive output, value treated as `sh -c '...'` because git uses `system(3)`. RCE.
    - `PAGER='sh -c "id"' systemctl status nginx` — same shape; systemctl uses pager if stdout is a tty. With `no-pty` set, stdout is NOT a tty → PAGER not invoked. **`no-pty` is load-bearing for this whole class.** Verify in add_server.go.
    - `SYSTEMD_PAGER='sh -c "id"' SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0 journalctl -u nginx` — same shape; systemd recommends "secure mode" but the default depends on `journalctl`'s detection of elevated privileges. journalctl in `no-pty` may also short-circuit, but **the attacker controls both env vars**, so they can force pager invocation if any code path inside journalctl uses it without checking ttyness. [14]
    - `IFS=$'\\n'; cmd` — IFS injection is a parameter-expansion concern, only relevant if classifier-allowed commands have unquoted variable expansions internally. Not a direct vehicle on its own; defer.
- **Severity:** **BLOCKER for the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF / GIT_SSH_COMMAND / PAGER vectors.** These work today against `git log` / `git ls-remote` / any read-allowlisted command that respects pagers. No additional capabilities required beyond what the gate already grants.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:221-224 (the strip-and-ignore) plus 308 onward (allowlist of git/journalctl/systemctl).
- **Fix sketch (research, not code):** maintain a **deny-list of dangerous env keys** that, if set in the prefix, force KindWrite regardless of head. Minimal initial list: `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_AUDIT`, `PATH`, `IFS`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `PAGER`, `MANPAGER`, `LESS`, `LESSOPEN`, `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, `SYSTEMD_PAGER`, `SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE`, `GIT_*` (anything starting with `GIT_`), `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, `GIT_SSH`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_PAGER`, `GIT_EDITOR`. Better yet: an **allowlist** of safe env vars (e.g. `LC_*`, `LANG`, `TZ`) and deny everything else.

### B5 — Heredoc and herestring
- **Status:** **PARTIAL / MAJOR.** Classifier does not parse heredoc syntax at all. `cat <<EOF >/tmp/x` has the `>` at top level, so `hasTopLevelRedirect` (line 133-151) catches it → write. **But** `cat /etc/hosts <<<"$(rm /tmp/x)"` — the herestring `<<<` introduces a string that bash evaluates with full expansion. The `<` triggers the `containsSubstitution` check only if followed by `(`. `<<<` has `<<<"$(...)"` — the `$(` *is* inside the string, **but at byte-level scan it's still `<` `<` `<` `"` `$(` ...** the classifier walks left-to-right and sees `$(` at some index → `containsSubstitution` returns true → KindWrite. Accidentally safe.
- **Counter-case:** `cat <<<"$VAR"` — no `$(`, just `$V`. classifier passes it to /bin/sh. Whatever bash does with `$VAR` is whatever bash does. If `$VAR` happened to be set by the attacker via env (`VAR='$(rm /tmp/x)' cat <<<"$VAR"`), the classifier sees env-strip leaves `cat <<<"$VAR"` — head `cat` (allowed), no `$(`. → READ → executed. **But**: bash's `<<<` does NOT recursively expand `$(...)`. It does parameter expansion (`$VAR` → the literal string `$(rm /tmp/x)` as set), and the resulting string goes to cat's stdin. cat just prints it. **Safe** but only by bash semantics, not by classifier check.
- **Real concern with heredocs:** `cat <<EOF; rm /tmp/x; EOF` — classifier splits on `;` so segment 1 = `cat <<EOF`, segment 2 = `rm /tmp/x`, segment 3 = `EOF`. The bash semantics: `<<EOF; rm /tmp/x; EOF` is invalid syntax (bash will error). Accidentally safe.
- **Verdict:** No exploitable direct path. **MINOR** — add corpus rows for `<<`, `<<-`, `<<<` with substitution and without.

### B6 — Brace expansion `cp {a,b,c} d`
- **Status:** **N/A.** `cp` isn't in the read allowlist anyway; entire line classified as write. NIT.

### B7 — Glob abuse `cat /tmp/*`
- **Status:** **NIT.** Glob expansion is done by shell after classifier sees the line. Classifier sees `cat /tmp/*` → head `cat` (allowed) → READ. Shell expands `/tmp/*` and runs `cat file1 file2 ...`. No write happens because cat doesn't write. **Real glob-abuse concern**: globs that *trick the read into a write* would require an allowed command that takes filenames as flags. E.g. if attacker stages a file named `--in-place` in cwd, then `sed -e s/a/b/ *` could expand `*` to include `--in-place`. **VULNERABLE — MAJOR.** Worked exploit: attacker writes a file `-i` in cwd (write requires approval but `touch -- '-i'` requires `touch` which is write). So they'd need write first. **NIT-MAJOR borderline**: theoretically real, requires a prior write that already requires approval. Mark MINOR.

### B8 — Rare control operators: `|&`, `&>`, `>(...)`, `<>`
- `|&` — see B2. Stray `&` survives segmentation; head of the trailing segment is whatever followed `&`, likely unknown → write. NIT.
- `&>` — `&` followed by `>`. `splitSegments` flushes at `&`, then the `&` advances by 1. Next char `>` is read as a regular char by segmentation, and `>` at any unquoted position triggers `hasTopLevelRedirect` → write. **COVERED.**
- `>(...)` — process substitution; `containsSubstitution` catches it. **COVERED.**
- `<>` — file open for read+write. classifier walks bytes: at `<`, next byte must be `(` for it to trip substitution; `>` follows but `<` already incremented past. Then `>` triggers `hasTopLevelRedirect` → write. **COVERED.**

### B9 — Editor / pager interactive escapes (`less !sh`, `vim :!sh`, `man → less !sh`, `git log → less !sh`, `journalctl → less !sh`)
- **Status:** **BLOCKER if PTY is enabled, MITIGATED if `no-pty` is enforced.** SSHGate's `add_server` writes `command="...",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding` (audit S8, src/mcp/tools/add_server.go:284-294). **The audit does not mention `no-pty`.** Without `no-pty`, every one of these works against the v1 gate:
  - `less /var/log/syslog` — classifier returns READ → shell runs less. On a PTY, type `v` → opens `$EDITOR` (default vim) → `:!rm /tmp/x` → RCE. Or `!sh` directly.
  - `git log` — same path, `git` pipes to less.
  - `journalctl -u nginx` — same.
  - `man <foo>` — `man` isn't allowlisted (good), but `less /usr/share/man/...gz` is. NIT.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:309 (`less` in allowlist), and **src/mcp/tools/add_server.go (the missing `no-pty` setting)**. Need to verify by reading that file.

### B10 — Read commands that mutate state (the find / awk / sed / journalctl class)
This is the highest-yield bypass class — every entry below is a direct, no-clever-shell, single-command path from "classified read" to "writes to disk" or "executes arbitrary command":

#### B10a — **`sed e` flag (the `s/x/y/e` GNU substitution flag) executes the replacement as a shell command**
- **Status: BLOCKER.** `sedRule` (classifier.go:404-420) only checks for `-i` / `--in-place`. The `e` flag is *inside the sed program* (the script argument), not a command-line flag. Example:
  - `sed 's/.*/id/e' /etc/hosts` — runs `id` for every line in /etc/hosts. Classifier returns READ.
  - `echo nothing | sed 's/.*/rm \/tmp\/x/e'` — runs `rm /tmp/x`.
  - Also the standalone `e` sed command: `sed -n '1e rm /tmp/x' /etc/hosts`.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:404 (sedRule).
- **Source:** [15] GNU sed manual.

#### B10b — **`find -fprintf` / `-fprint` / `-fls` write arbitrary files**
- **Status: BLOCKER.** `findRule` (classifier.go:394-401) blocks `-delete`, `-exec`, `-execdir`, `-ok`, `-okdir`. It does **not** block:
  - `-fprintf FILE FORMAT` — like `-printf` but writes to FILE.
  - `-fprint FILE` — writes matched paths to FILE.
  - `-fprint0 FILE` — same with null delimiters.
  - `-fls FILE` — ls-style listing to FILE.
- Example RCE: `find /etc -name hosts -fprintf /tmp/x "evil content"` — classifier says read; find writes `/tmp/x`. Pair with `-fprintf ~/.ssh/authorized_keys "ssh-rsa AAAA..."` (the file is path-traversable by the gate user) → persistent backdoor. **No env vars, no quotes, no chaining needed.**
- **File:line:** classifier.go:394-401 (findRule).
- **Source:** GNU find(1) manpage.

#### B10c — **`awk` system() / getline pipe / -v assigning ENVIRON**
- **Status: BLOCKER.** `awk` is allowlisted with `nil` rule (classifier.go:329) — every invocation is read. Examples:
  - `awk 'BEGIN{system("rm /tmp/x")}'` — runs rm. [11]
  - `awk 'BEGIN{while(("id"|getline line)>0) print line}'` — same thing, pipe form.
  - `awk -v cmd='rm /tmp/x' 'BEGIN{system(cmd)}'`.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:329.

#### B10d — **`git log` with custom format / external diff via env**
- See B4 — env-var injection. **BLOCKER via env, MAJOR via inline:** `git -c core.pager='sh -c "id"' log` — classifier sees `git log` head; `-c` injects config. Classifier doesn't scan past head. Worth confirming whether `git -c ...` reaches gitRule's `firstNonFlag` (which skips `-c`-style flags) — it does (line 614-622). So `git -c <evil> log` → firstNonFlag returns `log` → READ. Then git honors the injected config. **MAJOR.**

#### B10e — **Pure-data commands that nonetheless write**
- `tar --to-command=CMD` — tar is not allowlisted, but if added → write surface. Currently safe.
- `gzip --list` — read; safe.
- `apt update` — not allowlisted; correctly write.
- `journalctl --rotate` / `journalctl --vacuum-size=...` — classifier puts `journalctl` as nil-rule allow. `journalctl --rotate` IS a write. **MAJOR.** `journalctl --vacuum-time=1s` deletes journal data.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:376.

### B11 — TOCTOU between parse and shell
- **Status:** **COVERED-ISH / MINOR.** Classifier parses the literal `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` string; same string goes verbatim to `/bin/sh -c`. There is no race because there is no separate "fetch the command" step between parse and exec; both consume the same bytes. **However**, if the command contains a path to a script (`bash /tmp/foo.sh`), classifier sees `bash` as not-allowlisted → write. Currently `bash`, `sh`, `source`, `.` are not in the read allowlist — **good**. NIT to double-check `python`, `perl`, `ruby`, `node`, `lua`, `php` — none are in the allowlist (verified by reading lines 308-390); all default to write. **COVERED.**

### B12 — Aliases / shell functions / `.bashrc` poisoning
- **Status:** **N/A by execution model.** Gate runs `/bin/sh -c <cmd>` (executor.go:38), which does NOT source the user's `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.zshrc`. `/bin/sh` non-interactive ignores those. **COVERED.**
- **Caveat:** Some systems symlink `/bin/sh` → `bash`. Bash in `sh` POSIX mode still reads `$ENV` if set. If env-var injection (B4) sets `ENV=/tmp/evil`, the spawned `sh -c` may source it. **Already covered by B4's fix.**

### B13 — `find -exec` / `find -execdir` etc.
- **Status:** **COVERED.** `findRule` blocks these (classifier.go:395-399). The bypass is via `-fprintf`, not `-exec` — see B10b.

### B14 — Sourcing files (`source X` or `. X`)
- **Status:** **COVERED.** `source` and `.` are not in the read allowlist; they default to write. NIT to add explicit corpus row.

### B15 — Argument injection via env-injected `$VAR`
- **Status:** **MINOR.** SSHGate forwards `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` as-is to `/bin/sh -c`. Any other env vars the client sent via `LC_*` / SendEnv channels arrive at gate's process. If sshd `AcceptEnv` is configured permissively, attacker controls them. Recommend an explicit `AcceptEnv` in the install playbook restricting to (or completely disallowing) inbound env. **MINOR docs/install hardening.**

### B16 — Carriage-return / null-byte tricks
- **Status:** **COVERED.** `hasPrintable` (classifier.go:82-91) skips `\0`, space, tab, newline, CR. Tokenize splits on space/tab/newline/CR (line 271). Allowlist comparison is exact-string. A command containing `\r` will be tokenized into pieces split by `\r`. If `\r` is inside quotes, tokenize keeps it (line 264-266). Head token can contain `\r`, won't match `"cat"`. → write. **COVERED**, but **MINOR** to add a corpus row.

### B17 — Wrapper binaries (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `time`, `chroot`, `unshare`, `setsid`, `taskset`)
- **Status:** **VULNERABLE — MAJOR.** None of these are in the read allowlist, so `env cat /etc/hosts` → head `env` (allowed as read because it's in the allowlist for "env" the introspection command, classifier.go:348). **Wait** — `env` is in the allowlist as nil-rule allow. **And `env` is also the wrapper-binary that runs a child command.** Example:
  - `env rm /tmp/x` — classifier sees `env` (allowed) → READ. /bin/sh runs `env rm /tmp/x` → rm executes. **RCE / unauthorized write.**
  - `env -i rm /tmp/x` — same, with cleared env.
  - `env LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so cat /etc/hosts` — env-var injection (B4) + the env-wrapper double-up.
- **File:line:** classifier.go:348.
- This is the OpenClaw "wrapper unwrap" finding [3, 4]. SSHGate is **vulnerable today** to `env <anything-write>`.

### B18 — Busybox / toybox multiplexers
- **Status:** **NIT** because `busybox` is not in the read allowlist. `busybox cat /etc/hosts` → head `busybox` → not allowed → write. **COVERED accidentally.** But if any future contributor adds `busybox` to the allowlist (e.g. for an Alpine box), it becomes the OpenClaw bypass [3, 4]. Document as a contributor-facing trap.

### B19 — `git log --format='%(reflog:short)'` and other format-string CEs
- **Status:** **MINOR.** `git log --format=...` cannot directly exec, but `--format=%(...)` does evaluate some directives. The risk is bounded; gitRule treats `log` as read.

### B20 — `curl --upload-file` / `curl -K configfile`
- **Status:** Mixed. curlRule (classifier.go:426-466) catches `-T`/`--upload-file` (line 437) — write. **COVERED.** `-K`/`--config FILE` reads curl directives from a file — that file can contain `-o /tmp/x` to write. `-K` is **not in curlRule** → curl runs the line as read but actually writes per the configfile. **MAJOR.** Need `-K` / `--config` → write or to require the configfile arg to be `-` only.

### B21 — Long-option abbreviation (GNU getopt)
- **Status:** **VULNERABLE — MAJOR.** Per OpenClaw [3, 4]: GNU getopt accepts `--in` for `--in-place`. sedRule (classifier.go:407-417) checks exact strings `-i`, `--in-place`, and `--in-place=` prefix. **`sed --in-pl 's/x/y/g' file`** — `--in-pl` is an unambiguous prefix of `--in-place`. GNU sed accepts it. classifier sees no match for `-i*` family. → READ. → file mutated. **BLOCKER-adjacent**, calling MAJOR because the win is "mutate one file via sed" not "arbitrary RCE." Combined with B4/B10a it's BLOCKER.

### B22 — Signature payload re-entry
- **Status:** **COVERED.** Audit S7 (security-audit-2026-05-19.md) verified that the trailing-cmd in the wire format never reaches execution; `payload.Cmd` is the only source. **COVERED.**

### B23 — Stdin smuggling
- Gate forwards `os.Stdin` to /bin/sh (executor.go:41). If the client sends a here-string via `ssh host 'cat' <<< 'data'`, the data arrives on cat's stdin. Cat prints it. No write. **COVERED** for cat-class commands.
- **However**: `ssh host 'tee /tmp/x' <<< 'data'` — `tee` is not in the allowlist → write. **COVERED.** `ssh host 'dd of=/tmp/x'` — `dd` not allowed → write. **COVERED.**

## Recommendations / findings to file

Severity scale per task: BLOCKER (exploitable today by reading the classifier), MAJOR (requires modest chaining or operator misconfig), MINOR (defense-in-depth or theoretical), NIT (cosmetic / hardening).

### BLOCKER-1 — `sed` `e` flag and `s///e` substitution execute shell commands
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:404-420` (sedRule).
- **Exploit:** `sed 's/.*/id/e' /etc/hosts` → classifier returns READ → gate runs sed → sed runs `id`.
- **Fix sketch:** Walk all non-flag tokens in the sed program; if any contains an unescaped `e` immediately after a `/`-delimited substitution or as a standalone command, return KindWrite. Simpler: route sed through write whenever the program contains any of: `s/.../e`, ` e ` (e command), `/e`, `;e ;`. Cleanest: only allow sed with `-n` and `-e '<regex>p'` patterns matching a strict allowlist; everything else → write. Or just: only allow sed when invoked with `-n` and no script text containing `e` in non-quoted context (hard to parse). The defensible v1.2 fix is to **add `sed` to write unless invoked with a script that the classifier can prove is e-flag-free**. Practical: scan all args; if any contains `/e` or starts with `e` (and is not a flag), → write. Document the conservative rejection rate.

### BLOCKER-2 — `find -fprintf` / `-fprint` / `-fls` / `-fprint0` write arbitrary files
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:394-401` (findRule).
- **Exploit:** `find /etc -name hosts -fprintf ~/.ssh/authorized_keys "ssh-rsa AAAA..."` → classifier READ → find writes the file.
- **Fix sketch:** Extend findRule's write-flag set: add `-fprint`, `-fprint0`, `-fprintf`, `-fls`. While in there, also block `-delete` is already there, also consider `-printf '%H'` is harmless but `-printf` itself isn't a write vector.

### BLOCKER-3 — Environment-variable smuggling via `KEY=VAL cmd` and dangerous keys (LD_PRELOAD, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF, GIT_SSH_COMMAND, PAGER, etc.)
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:221-224` (the env-prefix strip).
- **Exploit:**
  - `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF='sh -c "id"' git log -p HEAD` → classifier strips env, sees `git log -p HEAD` → READ → git forks the diff driver as `sh -c "id"`.
  - `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='sh -c "id"' git ls-remote origin` → classifier READ; git forks the SSH command.
  - `LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so cat /etc/hosts` (requires prior write of `/tmp/evil.so`, so chained but not theoretical).
- **Fix sketch:** Replace "strip and ignore" with "strip and inspect." Maintain a **deny-list of env keys** that, when present in the leading-assignment prefix, force KindWrite. Minimum viable list:
  - Linker / loader: `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_AUDIT`, `LD_DEBUG`, `LD_BIND_NOW`.
  - Shell internals: `PATH`, `IFS`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `PS4`.
  - Pagers: `PAGER`, `MANPAGER`, `LESS`, `LESSOPEN`, `LESSCLOSE`, `MORE`, `SYSTEMD_PAGER`, `SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE`.
  - Editors: `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`.
  - Per-tool RCE-via-env: any var matching `GIT_*` (and explicitly `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, `GIT_SSH`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_PAGER`, `GIT_EDITOR`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`).
- **Stronger alternative:** allow only a hardcoded *allowlist* of safe env keys (`LC_*`, `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`, `TZ`, `TERM`) and reject everything else. This is more robust against future tool additions.

### BLOCKER-4 (borderline-MAJOR) — `awk 'BEGIN{system(...)}'` is direct RCE under a read classification
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:329` (`"awk": nil`).
- **Exploit:** `awk 'BEGIN{system("rm /tmp/x")}'` → READ → awk forks the shell call.
- **Fix sketch:** Add `awkRule` analogous to `sedRule`: scan all non-flag tokens; if any contains `system(`, `getline`, `"|"`, `printf`-into-file via `>` or `>>` inside an awk string, etc., return write. This is even harder to do robustly than sed; an alternative is to **drop `awk` from the read allowlist** entirely. Pipe-receiving awk is the common safe case (`ps aux | awk '{print $1}'`); standalone-pattern `awk 'BEGIN{...}'` is rare in operator workflows.

I'm classifying this BLOCKER because the exploit string is one-line, no chaining, no env tricks.

### MAJOR-1 — `env` wrapper executes arbitrary commands while classified as read
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:348` (`"env": nil`).
- **Exploit:** `env rm /tmp/x` → READ → /bin/sh runs `env rm` → rm executes.
- **Fix sketch:** Treat `env` specially. Either remove from allowlist, or add a rule: `env` is read only when invoked with no positional args (`env` alone prints the environment) or with `-`/`--unset`/`-u`/`-i` and **no trailing command**. The moment a non-flag, non-`KEY=VAL` token appears, treat as a wrapper and classify the trailing command. Even simpler: drop `env` from allowlist; the read use case (print env) is duplicated by `printenv` which is already allowlisted.

### MAJOR-2 — `journalctl --rotate` / `--vacuum-*` are writes classified as read
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:376` (`"journalctl": nil`).
- **Exploit:** `journalctl --rotate` rotates the journal; `journalctl --vacuum-time=1s` deletes journal data.
- **Fix sketch:** Add `journalctlRule` rejecting `--rotate`, `--vacuum-size`, `--vacuum-time`, `--vacuum-files`, `--flush`, `--relinquish-var`, `--smart-relinquish-var`, `--sync`, `--update-catalog`.

### MAJOR-3 — `git -c <key>=<val>` config injection bypasses gitRule
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:554-571` (gitRule) and 614-622 (firstNonFlag).
- **Exploit:** `git -c core.pager='sh -c "id"' log` → firstNonFlag skips `-c <kv>` and returns `log` → READ. Git honors `core.pager` and runs `sh -c "id"`.
- **Fix sketch:** When `git -c` appears in args, scan the `-c key=val` pair; if `key` matches any RCE-relevant config (`core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand`, `diff.external`, `pager.*`, `alias.*`), force write. Easier: any `git -c` invocation → write (lose a small power-user surface, gain a definite property).

### MAJOR-4 — GNU long-option abbreviation: `sed --in-pl` bypasses sedRule
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:407-417`.
- **Exploit:** `sed --in-pl 's/foo/bar/g' /etc/hosts` — `--in-pl` is unambiguous prefix of `--in-place`; GNU sed accepts; classifier compares exact strings and finds no match → READ → file mutated.
- **Fix sketch:** Implement GNU prefix-match for known dangerous long options. Build a per-binary list of "dangerous long options" and reject any token that is a non-ambiguous prefix of one (`startsWith(canonical, token[2:])`). Or canonicalize tokens first via a binary-specific table.

### MAJOR-5 — `curl -K`/`--config FILE` runs directives that can write
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:426-466` (curlRule).
- **Exploit:** Stage a file with `output = /tmp/x`; `curl -K /tmp/config https://example.com` → classifier read; curl writes per config. Requires prior file write but those happen via the same gate.
- **Fix sketch:** Add `-K`, `--config` to curlRule; require operand to be `-` (stdin) only, else write.

### MINOR-1 — `no-pty` not explicitly documented in authorized_keys writer
- **File:line:** `src/mcp/tools/add_server.go:284-294` (per existing audit S8).
- **Exploit:** Without `no-pty`, every classified-read pager (`less`, `more`, `journalctl`, `git log`, `systemctl status`) gains its interactive escape (`!sh`, `v`-to-editor). With `no-pty`, those are short-circuited.
- **Fix sketch:** Add `no-pty` to the canonical authorized_keys line. Verify by reading the file. (I haven't loaded it in this research; flagging for the auditor.)

### MINOR-2 — Read-side `find /tmp/* -fprint*` write categories not in corpus
- **File:line:** `tests/testdata/classifier-corpus.txt`.
- **Fix sketch:** Add corpus rows for `-fprint`, `-fprintf`, `-fls`, sed `e` flag, awk `BEGIN{system(...)}`, `env rm`, `git -c core.pager=...`, `curl -K`, `sed --in-pl`.

### MINOR-3 — `|&` segmentation edge case
- **File:line:** `src/classify/classifier.go:184-191`.
- Stray `&` becomes leading char of next segment. Defensive: handle `|&` explicitly.

### MINOR-4 — Heredoc / herestring corpus coverage
- Add `cat <<<EOF` / `cat <<<"$VAR"` / `cat <<EOF` rows to lock current behavior.

### MINOR-5 — `AcceptEnv` install-side guidance
- Document in `docs/install-step-by-step.md` that the sshd_config for the gate-using host should set `AcceptEnv` to empty (or omit entirely). Otherwise client-passed env vars bypass even a fixed env deny-list.

### MINOR-6 — Glob expanding into flag-like filenames
- **File:line:** classifier.go (general).
- Add corpus row `sed -e s/a/b/ *` with note: if cwd contains a file `-i`, sed picks it up as a flag. Bounded by prior-write requirement.

### NIT-1 — `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting not modeled by tokenize.
### NIT-2 — Heredoc body not parsed; substitution inside heredoc body unchecked. (Bash semantics make most cases inert; document.)
### NIT-3 — `busybox` / `toybox` not in allowlist now; add a contributor-facing comment "never add these without unwrap logic."
### NIT-4 — `man` not allowlisted; `info` not allowlisted; ensure docs note these are deliberately omitted.

## Open research questions

1. **Does the gate's `/bin/sh` ever symlink to bash?** On Debian/Ubuntu it's dash; on RHEL it's bash. Bash in `sh` mode honors `ENV=$file` which adds another RCE-via-env vector (covered by BLOCKER-3's fix). Confirm on the install target distro mix.
2. **Does sshd `AcceptEnv` default block all client env?** Default is empty (block); but Karthi's install script doesn't explicitly set it. Verify by reading the install scripts.
3. **`no-pty` audit**: I did not load `src/mcp/tools/add_server.go` in this research. The follow-up auditor should verify the canonical `command="..."` line includes `no-pty` and reject any add_server flow that writes a line without it. MINOR-1 hinges on this.
4. **`sigwire` payload size limits / canonical JSON re-marshaling determinism.** Out-of-scope here but: `json.Marshal(payload)` (verify.go:42) round-trips through Go's encoder. If a future Go version changes encoder behavior (e.g. omitempty handling, map ordering, escape policy), signatures stop verifying. This is unrelated to this research's classifier-bypass scope but worth raising.
5. **Are there other Linux tools in the allowlist with an "exec on read" hidden feature that I haven't caught?** Candidates to audit: `wc -L --files0-from=...`, `du --files0-from=...`, `find ... -newer`, `dig +sigchase` (DNS exec hooks), `lsof` (none known). The exhaustive sweep needs a per-binary read of GTFOBins + manpage.
6. **Carriage return + line-continuation inside SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND**: did not exhaustively test what happens when the classified line ends with `\` and continues on the next "line" (sshd typically joins to one line, but `tr` and quoting can re-introduce). OpenClaw's line-continuation CVE [3, 4] suggests this surface is non-empty; corpus needs coverage.
