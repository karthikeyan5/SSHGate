# SSHGate end-to-end test strategy

This is the standing verification strategy for SSHGate. Run it as a gate, not
as an afterthought:

| When | Command | Needs Docker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Before every push** | `make preflight` | no |
| **After a large build / before a release** | `make e2e` | yes |

Both are real gates. A green `preflight` is the bar for pushing; a green `e2e`
is the bar for declaring a build done or cutting a release. Don't push on a red
preflight, and don't claim an install/feature works end-to-end without an `e2e`
run (the Docker layer is where "deploy the gate and run a command over real SSH"
is actually proven).

## `make preflight` — before every push (fast, no Docker)

Runs, in order:

1. `make vet` — `go vet ./...`.
2. `make test` — `go test -race ./...` (the full unit + in-process suite,
   including the in-process MCP-client tests that prove the tool surface
   actually serves).
3. `make gitleaks` — scans the commits about to be pushed (`origin/main..HEAD`)
   for secrets. Scanning the push delta (not full history) keeps intentional
   fake-secret test fixtures on other branches from failing an unrelated push.
   Install gitleaks before pushing; the target warns loudly if it is absent.
4. `make build` — a clean `go build` of every binary.

## `make e2e` — after a large build / before a release (needs Docker)

Runs everything in `preflight`, then:

5. `make test-integration` — `go test -race -tags=integration ./tests/integration/...`.
   Boots a real `linuxserver/openssh-server` container and exercises the full
   path: `add_server` deploys the gate over SSH, a read command streams back,
   a write is denied at the gate (read-only / Tier-1), and the signed/Tier-2
   paths where present. This is the load-bearing "it actually works" layer.
6. `make smoke` — `scripts/smoke-fresh-install.sh`. The headless fresh-user
   regression: spawns `sshgate-mcp` with an empty `HOME` (no config, no key)
   and asserts it reaches `ready` instead of hard-exiting. Guards the
   chicken-and-egg bug where the server refused to start before `/sshgate:setup`
   created the key, leaving a fresh read-only user with a dead tool surface.

## What can't be headless — the manual fresh-user install check

The Claude Code plugin + slash-command layer (`/plugin install`,
`/sshgate:setup`, `/sshgate:add`) can't be driven from `go test`. After changes
to the install flow, the binaries, or the MCP startup, do one real fresh-user
pass on a clean machine (or a throwaway user / container) and confirm the
**Tier-1 read-only** path end-to-end:

1. `go version` ≥ 1.25; `git clone`; `make install-local`; confirm
   `command -v sshgate-mcp` resolves on `$PATH`.
2. `/plugin marketplace add <clone>`, `/plugin install sshgate@sshgate`,
   `/reload-plugins` — confirm the `sshgate` tools appear (the MCP server must
   come up even though no key exists yet; this is what `make smoke` guards
   headlessly).
3. `/sshgate:setup` → Tier 1. Then `/sshgate:add <alias> <user@host>` against a
   reachable Linux box — confirm it deploys without a reload and a read
   (`run df -h`) streams back while a write is denied.
4. `/sshgate:status` shows the signer as `not configured (read-only / Tier 1)`
   — that's healthy, not an error.

The **Tier-2** signer + Telegram-approval path needs the operator's hardware
(the master key under `sshgatesigner`, a Telegram bot, a real phone tap) and is
verified with the one-time live checklist, not in CI.
